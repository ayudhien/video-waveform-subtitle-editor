1
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,080
Imagine not having to put
a limit on yourself,

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:12,400
based on your need for an income.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,840
Not letting the obligation
that you have to do this or that,

4
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,920
or you won't have food
to put on the table,

5
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:23,080
or a roof over your head,
control your choices.

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,760
If you had the basics taken care of,
- food, clothing, shelter, health -

7
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,640
what would you spend your days doing?

8
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,160
What's the first thing
that comes to your mind?

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,160
If you want to start a business,

10
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,360
develop a new idea,
devote yourself to your art,

11
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,840
or dedicate your life to helping others,

12
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,840
how much opportunity do you have to do so?

13
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,160
How much time and energy left over

14
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,480
after eight hours at work
and two in a commute?

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,960
How much freedom
after bankrupting that business

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,360
you finally took a chance at starting?

17
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,360
If it fails, that might
very well be the end of it,

18
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,520
your last chance to live your dream
gone into debt and disillusionment.

19
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,000
For those of us who have no fallback,
no economic safety net,

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,720
the stress that gives rise to,

21
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,560
is a burden we carry with us
in all that we do.

22
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,400
What a difference it could make
if we were able to set that burden down.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,080
What a difference it would make

24
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,520
if we were able
to take a chance and mess up

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,520
and know that our bills
would still get paid,

26
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,960
because making mistakes

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,920
is far more valuable
than we give it credit for.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,240
Failure is inherent in all learning.

29
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,680
The path to mastery
is through constant failure

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,800
and constant readjustment
in response to that failure,

31
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,880
again, and again, and again.

32
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:51,880
What if all those who failed,
and had to go back to their day jobs,

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:55,520
had gotten a second, a third, a fourth,
a perpetual chance even.

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,320
Where would we be today?

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,440
Cancer cured, flying cars,
a colony on Mars?

36
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:09,640
The world that I imagine
as a result of this thought experiment

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,560
is a world that I believe we can reach.

38
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,680
But the only way to reach it
is if people are truly free.

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,440
The type of freedom

40
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,400
that comes from equal opportunities
and the ability to make choices,

41
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
based on not what you have
to do to survive,

42
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:29,200
but what you want to do to thrive.

43
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,080
We could do this by providing
a universal basic income to everyone.

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,880
Now, in its simplest form,
the idea of a universal basic income

45
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,520
means that everyone should receive
an amount of money

46
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:45,480
sufficient to make ends meet,
regardless of their circumstances,

47
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:48,880
like employment,
social status, or even need.

48
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,160
Then, those who are able,
or wish to supplement their income,

49
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,560
are then free to take
any work that they choose.

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,720
The income they receive from that work

51
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,640
would be an addition
to their universal basic income,

52
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,880
- after taxes, of course.

53
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,040
The basic income is unconditional

54
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,360
in that nothing you do or don't do
will affect you receiving it.

55
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,960
It enshrines the principle
that we are all valued members

56
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,720
of these human societies
we've created all over the world.

57
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,760
We have a right to share
in their collective wealth.

58
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,160
The philosopher, Thomas Paine,

59
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:29,760
in 1797 wrote a pamphlet
called "Agrarian Justice,"

60
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,120
where he makes an argument
for universal basic income.

61
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,040
He states that,

62
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:38,560
"The earth in its natural,
uncultivated state

63
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,400
was and ever would have continued to be
the common property of the human race."

64
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,440
He goes on to say,

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,440
"It is the value of the improvement only
and not of the earth itself

66
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,280
that is individual property,

67
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:55,520
and that the proprietor, therefore,
of cultivated lands,

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,000
owes to the community a ground rent
for the land which he holds."

69
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,440
Now, the idea that we should all receive
a dividend from our stake

70
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,920
and our shared ownership
of the planet's resources

71
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,160
is a powerful one,
and an important one for the future.

72
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:16,200
A future where technological advances
with machine learning and automation

73
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,600
are poised to greatly
disrupt our societies

74
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,560
and create an ever deepening inequality.

75
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,160
To counter this, we must find a way

76
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,360
to sever the connection
between work and income.

77
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,680
I believe that we have
a unique opportunity to do just that,

78
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,280
and at the same time, do away

79
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,520
with that very stress
of having to make ends meet

80
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:44,560
by working a job that, essentially,
a robot could do better.

81
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,440
A report published by Carl Benedikt Frey
and Michael Osborne of Oxford University

82
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:53,080
found that 47 percent of US jobs

83
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,440
are at risk of automation
in the next decade or two.

84
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,640
In poorer countries like India,
69 percent of jobs are at risk.

85
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,800
In China, 77 percent.

86
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,040
A report published
by the World Economic Forum

87
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,360
argues that job losses could be offset
by employment growth in other areas,

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,080
but comes to the conclusion

89
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,080
that the rise of robots will still lead
to a net loss of over five million jobs

90
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,400
in 15 major developed
and emerging economies,

91
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,120
by 2020.

92
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,360
These aren't just factory jobs
that we're talking about here.

93
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:28,120
Those jobs are already mostly gone
in the western world.

94
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,040
We're talking about cashiers,
telemarketers,

95
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:36,040
jobs in insurance and the food industry,
serving, office and administrative jobs,

96
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,440
sales, transportation

97
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,400
- the list goes on.

98
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,280
The power of machine learning

99
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,120
means that the jobs people thought
would be safe from automation

100
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:46,840
are now at risk too.

101
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,080
Katja Grace from Oxford's
Future of Humanity Institute

102
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,760
led a study asking the world's leading
researchers in artificial intelligence

103
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:06,520
when they think artificial intelligence
will be better than human beings
at a wide range of tasks.

104
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:12,560
North American researchers estimate
that this will happen in 74 years.

105
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,040
But their Asian counterparts
see this happening in just 30 years.

106
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,240
However you look at it,

107
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,920
before long AI will outsmart humans
in almost everything.

108
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,280
I think 30 years is a reasonable estimate,

109
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,400
but there are important factors
in slowing down automation.

110
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,680
One of those is likely
the cheapness of labor.

111
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,040
Think how difficult the fight
for higher wages will be in the future

112
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:44,360
where technology offers cheaper and more
efficient results than human labor.

113
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,680
In our current economic model

114
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,000
where income, and therefore survival,
is dependent on having a job,

115
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,600
workers will have
very little leverage to negotiate

116
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,520
as wages will be driven down
by the constant threat

117
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,360
of either outsourcing
to a cheaper labor force overseas,

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,120
or to robots.

119
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,320
In our current economic model,
who benefits from automation?

120
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,320
In the past,

121
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,000
the main benefactors
of technological advances

122
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,360
have been businesses, industry.

123
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,720
Technology has made
the world richer overall, yes,

124
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:18,920
but not everyone has benefited.

125
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:25,520
In 2009, the top 1 percent
owned 44 percent of the world's wealth.

126
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,320
In 2014, they had 48 percent.

127
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,840
By 2020, it is estimated

128
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:34,880
that the 1 percent will own
54 percent of global wealth.

129
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,040
Now, this concentration of wealth,
it doesn't have to continue,

130
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,600
we can change the system.

131
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,120
For the first time in history,
technology could lead us

132
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,320
to the abundance necessary
to enrich humanity on an individual level.

133
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,120
To get there,

134
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,480
we have to be brave and open-minded enough
to dream a better world,

135
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,240
and then take the steps
towards that world.

136
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,360
Right now, automation is a threat,
but it doesn't have to be.

137
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,120
With a universal basic income,
it could be our road to freedom.

138
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,240
To buy that freedom,

139
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:22,280
we need to stop running our economy
on the ideologies of the past

140
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,560
and start designing
the economy of the future.

141
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,200
Now, there are many ways

142
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,160
that we could fund
a universal basic income.

143
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,600
Most of them involve taxation reforms

144
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,840
that are sorely needed in our shifting,
highly technical, globalized economy.

145
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
We could, as Thomas Paine suggested,

146
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,560
start thinking differently
about the private ownership of land,

147
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,360
or even the resources
that we all need to survive.

148
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,760
We could start thinking differently

149
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,400
about innovation
and the ownership of ideas,

150
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,320
or the ownership of data
that we give freely to large corporations

151
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:01,240
who then profit from it,

152
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,640
or the ownership
of technological progress,

153
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,200
which has been driven
by centuries of interchanging ideas.

154
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,280
Many of the technical wonders
that we enjoy in our everyday lives,

155
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,640
like computers and smartphones,
are based on research

156
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,160
that, to some degree,
has been taxpayer funded

157
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:20,400
and are produced with resources,
many of them rare minerals,

158
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,680
that are sourced from
the very ground we all walk.

159
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,360
How should these profits be shared?

160
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,200
There's also mounting evidence

161
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,000
through the many experiments
that have been done

162
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,160
with universal basic income
all over the world,

163
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,040
that the system leads
to lower crime rates,

164
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,320
lower school dropout rates,

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,760
fewer accidents
and stress related illnesses,

166
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,280
whilst increasing the level
of education and entrepreneurship.

167
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,320
These findings,

168
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,960
along with the removal
of the burdens and bureaucracy

169
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,680
that comes with our current
welfare system,

170
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,320
would lead to massive savings
in taxpayer money

171
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,880
that could be diverted
into funding a universal basic income.

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,120
Now, these are just a few ideas.

173
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:10,080
They may seem implausible
or impossible even,

174
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,760
but where there's a will,
there's a way, no?

175
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,280
To better understand
where we are today and how we got here,

176
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,960
it is important to delve into the past

177
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,400
and to understand that the systems
that frame our lives

178
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,640
are man-made.

179
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,680
We can change them.

180
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:37,000
Our current man-made system is designed
to reach a goal grounded in ideology

181
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,360
that is today at odds
with an equitable and sustainable future.

182
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:43,680
That goal is maximum growth
of the economy.

183
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,400
In perpetuity, Adam Smith,

184
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:50,320
who's been coined
The Father of Modern Capitalism,

185
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,720
had a clear idea of how to get there,
of how to reach that goal,

186
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,280
by maximizing worker efficiency

187
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,960
and as a result,
production and consumption.

188
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,000
By breaking down complex processes
into many tiny steps,

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,600
each allotted to one worker,

190
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,000
human beings became little more
than cogs in the industrial machine,

191
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,040
whose output was an imagined
infinite economic growth.

192
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,560
It's interesting to note

193
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
that Adam Smith himself
pointed out the downfall of a system,

194
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,080
which in effect, employs human beings
into mindless drudgery

195
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,440
for half of their working life,

196
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,400
in order for them to make ends meet.

197
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:35,000
He warned that forcing individuals
to perform mundane and repetitive tasks

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,640
would lead to an ignorant
and dissatisfied workforce.

199
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,800
This was, it seems,
an acceptable side effect,

200
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,400
as the goal was, after all,
the material wealth of nations

201
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,160
and not an enlightened
and content population.

202
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,640
Smith, he believed monetary incentives
to be vital to get people to work.

203
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,880
After all, why would anyone choose

204
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,160
the hard and repetitive toil
that offer in the factories of his day,

205
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,920
if it wasn't absolutely
necessary for survival?

206
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,520
The preconception was

207
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,480
that human beings are, in essence,
lazy and to some degree untrustworthy,

208
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,960
unless incentivized monetarily
to be otherwise.

209
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:21,160
The same school of thought
was then applied to our education system,

210
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,280
where instead of money, exam scores,
and degrees, and certificates

211
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,680
are used to incentivize learning,

212
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,280
as well as being pre-requisites
for graduating and then finding a job.

213
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,600
From an early age, we become accustomed

214
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,600
to working for extrinsic,
rather than intrinsic rewards.

215
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,880
Instead of being motivated
from that feeling of accomplishment,

216
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:47,480
when you come to understand concepts
and their application in the world,

217
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,800
that eureka moment,
when you finally get something.

218
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,480
Instead of that,

219
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,040
we're motivated to memorize
words and labels,

220
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,640
repeating them like a parrot,
to pass that exam, get that degree,

221
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,640
and contribute to that common goal,
endless economic growth.

222
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,200
What's wrong with that?

223
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,840
Hasn't it served to make
all of our lives a lot more wealthy?

224
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,960
Yes, it has.

225
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,640
At least, materially it has,

226
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,440
but it's also led to, as Smith warned,
an uninformed, dissatisfied population

227
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,920
forever seeking extrinsic validation
and instant gratification.

228
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,520
The perfect consumer.

229
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:35,560
Pollution of land, sea, and air

230
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,560
are the other fruits of this
low cost approach to civilization,

231
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,200
where we consume more
with every passing year,

232
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,520
as if this planet
were actually expanding in step.

233
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,000
Many of the conditions
that make this planet beautiful,

234
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,920
bountiful, and capable
of sustaining human life

235
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,400
are facing threats so far gone,

236
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:00,040
that our current technology
might not be able to deal with them,

237
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,320
even if we made
a concerted effort to do so,

238
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,440
which we are not.

239
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,000
Despite this,

240
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:11,040
our measure for success and well-being
is still Gross Domestic Product.

241
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,640
The amount of stuff we produce
without any regard to actual need,

242
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,280
making our economic system work

243
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,280
against the very systems we rely on
for our survival and well-being.

244
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,920
What does this tell us?

245
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,840
Do we not have to rethink
our very definition of success?

246
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,920
What makes a nation truly wealthy?

247
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:40,280
I believe that to find these answers,

248
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:43,920
we have to be willing
to examine our core belief systems

249
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,880
and ask ourselves if they're serving us.

250
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,520
By us, I mean all of us,

251
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,000
because if we're to evolve as a species,

252
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:56,000
we must rise above the individual interest

253
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,160
and start looking towards the interest
of the collective, the whole.

254
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:03,920
Our world is fast changing, and with it,

255
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,080
the societies and the systems
that we've built to sustain us.

256
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,440
Now, these changes will happen
with or without our participation.

257
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,040
It's not a question of if,
but of when and how.

258
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,360
The how is something
we have a little control over,

259
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,120
but only to the extent
of how willing we are

260
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:26,120
to look at the paths ahead,
understand the inevitable changes we face,

261
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,040
and to prepare.

262
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,600
We must prepare.

263
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,520
These will be the deciding factors

264
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:38,440
and whether a particular change
will be positive or negative for society.

265
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:43,760
Now, the how might very well be
a universal basic income,

266
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,360
which has the potential
to both mitigate unemployment,

267
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,080
greatly accelerate the rate
of technological development,

268
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,200
possibly save the planet,

269
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:57,160
and make people be more fulfilled
and happy than they have ever been.

270
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,320
Now, I think that's worth a shot.

271
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:01,360
Don't you?

272
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,760
Thank you.

273
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,200
